# CodesofCapstoneProject
Here are the codes used to creating the data product for the data science capstone project [Word prediction app], you can visit below link to see the output: https://maxine.shinyapps.io/DataScienceCapstoneAppFinal/.  
  
This data product was built in R to deliver predictive text analysis. The model behind this is a predictive model of text trained by an extensive, unstructured database of the English language(provided by SwiftKey). I built an N-gram model and applied the Katz’s back-oﬀ model to tackle the unseen n-gram problem. And the ﬁnal presentation of this project is a shiny application in which the user can get the prediction of the next word according to the prior text they have input.
